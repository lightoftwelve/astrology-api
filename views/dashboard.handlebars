        <h2>Astrology Basics:</h2>
        <p>At its core, astrology is the mesmerizing dance of celestial bodies, and their influence on our
            lives,
            personalities, and destinies. Here's a brief dive into its captivating elements:</p>

        <!-- Sun Signs -->
        <div class="sun-signs">
            <img src="/image" alt="Sun Signs Image" />
            <p><strong>Sun Signs:</strong> Represented by the twelve zodiac symbols, your Sun Sign reflects the
                essence of your personality, the 'core you'. It's determined by where the sun was in the zodiac
                on
                the day of your birth. Ever been asked, "What's your sign?" This is what they're referring to!

        <!-- Houses -->
        <div class="houses">
            <img src="/image" alt="Houses Image" />
            <p><strong>Houses:</strong> Imagine a stage divided into twelve sections, each representing an area
                of
                your life. These are the astrological houses. Each house has its story, from your communication
                style to your career ambitions.</p>

            <p><strong>Aspects:</strong> As planets move, they form angles with each other called aspects. These
                cosmic connections tell tales of harmony, tension, opportunity, or challenge. The way planets
                'talk'
                to each other influences how we feel and act.</p>
